Starting from the car park after the tunnel in Å, find a small path with wooden tracks on the opposite side of the road. Follow the lake shore, sometimes using chains to climb the boulders. When you arrive at the small beach. the ascend to the coll starts. This is very steep but the view at the col is amazing. Take in the view and hike back down to the lake. Follow the other shore back to the E10. 

It is possible to camp near the beach or at some other places along the trail.
