Starting at the village of Sørvågen the trail ascents gently to the waterfall. Thereafter, you follow the shore of Stuvdalsvatnet. You'll leave the shore behind by ascending some slabs using a set of chains. After this initial first steep part, you're rewarded with the view on Tridalsvatnet. The trail is a bit flatter for a while. It starts ascending more steeply again when approaching the Djupfordheia. Arriving on top of this first summit gives you an impression of the views to come. Take a breath here and prepare for the final steep part up to the north summit of Munken. It is steep and strenuous, but the 360 panorama is worth it!

Prepare for a full day in the mountains and make sure to check the weather before leaving.
