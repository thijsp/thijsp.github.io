*Les Sentiers d'Art* - *The Art Trails*, measures almost 142 kilometers. As the name implies, along the route you will find different land art installations. Some more impressive than others, but all offer welcoming distractions after long walks and initiate some pondering. In Belgium you're not allowed to camp everywhere. However, there do exist some "wild" places where you are allowed to spend the night. Obviously, the *leave no trace* policy applies. One of the unique properties of Les Sentiers d'Art is the connection of 7 of these *bivouac*. Allowing you to spend 7 days in nature, without the need to book hotel rooms (it is not even possible to book these places). Additionally, these places all have a special art installation that allow you to sleep inside. Be carefull though, waterproofness of these installation is not guaranteed. We brought our tent, just in case.
