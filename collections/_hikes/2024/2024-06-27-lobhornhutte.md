Amazing hike, away from the crowds, in the Jungfrau region. This hike has everything: beautiful views, alpine lake and small cosy mountain hut. Because of public transport, this can be done as a circular route.

We started in the station of Lauterbrunnen and took bus 142 (every two hours) to Isenfluh. The bus ride itself is already spectacular and includes a 360 tunnel. In Isenfluh, take the cable car up. At the top of the lift there is a sign pointain towards the Lobhornhütte (1h20). Follow the well marked trail up. Enjoy the view on Wengen, Jungfraujoch and the Eiger North Face. 15 minutes before the hut, at a farm house, the path splits in three. Don’t cross the Sulsbach but follow the path towards Sulsseewli. Enjoy the lake. After a cold swim, head towards the hut. From there descend back towards the farmhouse and cross the Sulsbach over a wooden bridge. The path leads through the forest and some alpine meadows. Until finally arriving at Grütschalp where you can take the cable car back down to Lauterbrunnen. Take into account that the the second section (from the hut to Grütschalp) is a bit longer than the first.
