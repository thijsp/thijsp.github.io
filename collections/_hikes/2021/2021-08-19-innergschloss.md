Park at the Lucknerhaus, keep in mind the final stretch of the road is payed. Start the hike in the direction of the Lucknerhutte. From there it is a rather steep path towards the Stüdlhütte. If you only want to arrive in the hut by late afternoon, it is possible to leave just before lunch at the parking.

The next morning walk towards the Glorer Hütte. You can choose to either go over the very steep col, or follow a black trail. We opted for the black trail, some sure footedness is needed. 

Take a relaxing break in the hut. We even spotted a beardedvulture from the hut! Afterwards, the final descent towards the car park starts.
